# Discord bot for suggestions
It stores every suggestion in a local database and uses a vote system to rank suggestions based on the number of upvotes (suggestions can also be downvoted). Furthermore, it displays a daily top 5 and a weekly top 10 message with the most popular suggestions (a suggestion being the embeded message of the player).
